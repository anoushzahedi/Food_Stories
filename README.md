The impact of a fairytale-like story on the 
food choices of preschool children, test

The ongoing obesity epidemic is an indicator that traditional 
efforts towards diet change are insufficient, and interventions
focusing mainly on restrictions of unhealthy food are of limited 
success. Therefore, approaches targeting food preferences should 
be integral in counteracting the current epidemic. However, 
food preferences are affected by a multitude of factors and 
are usually resistant to changes later in life. Hence, we 
tested whether the food choices of preschool children can be 
changed by a child-appropriate, interactive, fairytale-like 
narrative. We used two interactive stories: the first (experimental) 
story was about how two protagonists of similar age as the 
participants saved their hometown from being drained of color 
with the help of magic fruits or vegetables, while the 
second (control) story consisted of a similar plot that 
did not mention food. In Experiment 1, we used a crossover 
design with a one-week baseline measurement. After the experimental 
stories, healthy food choices (i. e., pieces of fruit vs. cookies, 
sweets, or cake) increased significantly relative to the one-week 
baseline, whereas no change was observed after the control story. 
In preregistered Experiment 2, we replicated these results with 
vegetables as healthy options using a random control design and 
investigated the longevity of the effects. The food-story effect 
on vegetable choices was similar to fruits (Exp. 1) and lasted for 
two weeks. These findings demonstrate that appropriate narratives 
about food can have a strong and lasting effect on the healthy 
food choices of preschool children and might promote healthy food 
consumption if incorporated into nutrition education.
