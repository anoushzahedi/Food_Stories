## Abstract
Traditional efforts toward dietary change often focus on restricting unhealthy foods, which frequently yields limited success. This research investigates an alternative approach: targeting food preferences in preschool children through child-appropriate, interactive, fairytale-like narratives.

We tested whether interactive stories could shift food choices toward healthier options (fruits and vegetables) across two experiments.

### Experimental Design:
- **Experiment 1 (Fruits)**: A crossover design with a one-week baseline. Children heard a story where protagonists saved their town using "magic" fruits. Results showed a significant increase in healthy choices (fruit vs. sweets/cake) compared to baseline and a control story.
- **Experiment 2 (Vegetables - Preregistered)**: A randomized control design replicating the effect with vegetables. This experiment also assessed longevity, finding that the increased preference for healthy options lasted for at least **two weeks**.

### Key Findings:
- Child-appropriate narratives can significantly and positively impact food choices.
- The effect is robust across different food types (fruits and vegetables).
- The behavioral change persists for at least two weeks post-intervention, suggesting potential for integration into nutrition education.
